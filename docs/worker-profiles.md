# Worker Profiles

Worker Profiles are the operator-facing representation of an OpenClaw agent in AgentOS. They make a digital employee understandable without exposing raw OpenClaw configuration.

## Ownership

- **OpenClaw owns runtime execution:** agent id, model, workspace, agent state directory, skills allowlist, tools policy, sandbox policy, memory search, sessions, auth profiles, channel routing, and browser runtime.
- **AgentOS owns operator metadata:** worker role, mission, behavior instructions, and labels. This versioned sidecar lives in the workspace `.openclaw/project.json` agent entry.
- **AgentOS compiles behavior guidance:** the Worker Profile behavior text is rendered into the worker's generated `agent-policy-*` skill. It is guidance, never an authorization boundary.

The Worker Profile's Capabilities surface is a human-facing projection, not
another OpenClaw registry. Skills and declared tools describe configuration;
the effective capability rows are resolved from OpenClaw's current
session-effective tools, Skills Library selections, account state, policy,
approval, and runtime facts. OpenClaw remains authoritative for the native
skill definition, revision, ownership, activation, and tool state.

## Supported runtime mapping

| Worker Profile field | OpenClaw mapping |
| --- | --- |
| Display name / emoji / theme / avatar | `agents.entries.<agentId>.name` and `identity` |
| Mission | `agents.entries.<agentId>.description` |
| Model | `agents.entries.<agentId>.model` |
| Configured skills | `agents.entries.<agentId>.skills` |
| Tool profile and allow/deny | `agents.entries.<agentId>.tools.profile`, `allow`, `deny` |
| Workspace-only files | `agents.entries.<agentId>.tools.fs.workspaceOnly` |
| Sandbox | `agents.entries.<agentId>.sandbox.mode`, `scope`, `workspaceAccess` |
| Memory access | `agents.entries.<agentId>.memory.search.enabled`, `sources` |

AgentOS limits its profile editor to these schema-verified fields. It does not store or transmit credentials, OAuth tokens, browser cookies, sandbox environment variables, host mounts, extra memory paths, or provider configuration.

The native Skills Library is read through `skills.library.list` and
`skills.library.read`; supported session activation uses
`skills.library.activate` and applies on the next turn. Native `skillId` and
revision IDs are preserved. An existing session is never silently rewritten
to a newer revision.

The Memory & History surface keeps two facts separate: AgentOS Context Engine
memory files are workspace-sidecar context configuration, while the OpenClaw
native memory panel reads `memory.search` and `doctor.memory.*` directly through
the application service. Native memory health, search results, diary content,
and maintenance outcomes are projections of current OpenClaw state; AgentOS
does not create a local memory registry or vector store. When the native read
cannot be verified, the panel says so rather than treating the worker's memory
as unavailable.

## Account and browser boundaries

Connected accounts are AgentOS access-rule references. Browser profiles are visible through OpenClaw, but OpenClaw does not provide a typed browser-profile selection parameter for agent mission dispatch. The Worker Profile UI therefore reports this state honestly and never claims to assign a browser session to an agent.

## Write behavior

AgentOS updates OpenClaw through its existing config adapter. Existing unknown OpenClaw fields are preserved when the supported profile fields are changed. Configuration writes continue to use the Gateway-first config patch/apply path with the existing CLI fallback and diagnostics behavior.
